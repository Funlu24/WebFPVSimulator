/*
 * takeoff-check.js: roll the throttle on gently from the grass and watch the
 * camera, because the camera is what a pilot calls the craft.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two tickets on 4 and 5 October said the same thing in two
 * hands: bug-2d0907fa, "when I want to take off smoothly the quad starts
 * sinking into the ground first before it gets lift", and bug-eaae5428,
 * "when throttling up my drone is being pushed down". Both were flying the
 * 65 mm whoop on the five inch's plant. The plant was innocent: from rest on
 * a plane, a slow ramp leaves the ground near 42 percent and only ever goes
 * up. The picture was not. The parked lift (PARKED_LIFT in src/main.js), the
 * 30 cm the lens is raised while the craft sits on the ground, was eased away
 * the frame the craft was released at 25 percent, so the lens dropped toward
 * the grass for most of a second with the craft still sitting on it, and then
 * climbed. Measured before the fix, on the field, whoop, four second ramp:
 * camera 0.363 m to 0.061 m with four hull points on the ground.
 *
 * The camera read is the lens mount (`fpvY` in window.__craftState), which is
 * where the parked lift lives, and not the drawn camera, which the predicted
 * view moves a centimetre or two ahead of the mount while the craft is
 * accelerating. That lead is a different feature and is not this check's.
 *
 * Each case gets a page of its own: the airframe is seated from the settings
 * the first run starts with, and a second run on one page was seen to start
 * with no frames drawn, so nothing here depends on a page's history.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, per airframe, for a gentle ramp and a punch, sticks
 * centred, on flat ground:
 *   - the camera never drops more than SINK_TOL below the highest it has
 *     been since the throttle came up, until the craft is a metre up. A
 *     vertical takeoff is a picture that only rises.
 *   - by the time the craft is a metre up, the lift is gone: the lens is
 *     within LENS_TOL of the craft's centre, where the mount puts it.
 *   - the craft did take off, inside the time given.
 *
 * Not deterministic to the bit, because the sticks are written on the frame
 * clock of a headless browser, so every assertion is an inequality.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/takeoff-check.js. Exit code is the number of failures.
