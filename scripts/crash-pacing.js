/*
 * crash-pacing.js: one input stream, several frame rates, one crash.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: "A dropped frame must change nothing about the trajectory", and
 * a crash is a reset, so the crash is part of the trajectory. POLISH-PLAN.md
 * item 16 found it was not so. At the edge of the belly cone the wall verdict
 * read the attitude at the frame's end, and the ground judgement was gated on
 * the wall clock, so a pilot on a 60 Hz laptop and one on a 144 Hz monitor got
 * different crashes from the same tap (PROGRESS.md, 2026-09-25, "A belly first
 * wall tap is not a crash", found on the way, items 2 and 4). The owner
 * approved judging crashes per physics step on 2026-09-26 (POLISH-PLAN.md, the
 * owner's answers, 5), on the condition CLAUDE.md sets: the coverage first.
 * This is the coverage.
 *
 * HOW. Each scenario is flown once through dist/sim.wasm and Betaflight, one
 * step a frame, by a pilot on feedback, and what the pilot did is kept: the
 * sticks at every 4 ms RC slot and the step each angle mode switch came on.
 * That is the input stream. It is then flown again from the start at every
 * pacing below and every phase of it, the way src/main.js's frame loop flies
 * it: wall clock frames, dt capped at 100 ms, an accumulator, the frame's RC
 * samples handed to the module before its steps, and the steps one at a time
 * with the shell's crash judge (CrashJudge, src/game/collide.js) asked at the
 * points the frame loop asks it. What comes out is the verdict (a crash, and
 * which rule called it, or none) and the reset step: the sim clock of the last
 * step the frame flew, which is the state the shell sets the craft down from.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED.
 *
 *   GUARDS, which say the scenario is still the test it is named for:
 *     the flight is the same flight at every pacing, the state after every
 *     step bit identical to the one step a frame flight up to the verdict;
 *     the module's report summed in the shell (foldWorldReport) is the
 *     module's own once a frame report, to the bit; no frame ends in a perch
 *     before the verdict; and for the edge scenarios, the reading the shell
 *     used until 2026-09-26 (frameEndReading below) disagrees with itself
 *     across these pacings, so the flight still sits on the edge it was
 *     chosen for and a pass is not a flight that drifted off it.
 *   THE CHECK: the same verdict and the same reset step at every pacing and
 *     every phase, and the ground's judged hits on the same steps.
 *   ANCHORS: a steep nose first hit is a crash and a belly first tap is not,
 *     at every pacing, so agreeing is never bought by never resetting.
 *
 * Deterministic: Node only, no clock, no random, and no JS trigonometry on
 * anything that reaches the module (the pilots turn angles with
 * src/props/trig.js, as scripts/world-check.js's do).
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/crash-pacing.js [--only=name] [--verbose]
 * Exit code is the number of failed lines.
