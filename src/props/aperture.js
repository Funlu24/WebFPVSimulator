/*
 * aperture.js: what an opening is when it is not a rectangle. Pure arithmetic,
 * no Three.js.
 *
 * A gate's hole is a rectangle, and everything that has ever been said about a
 * pass says so: the swept box in src/game/race.js clips a segment against a
 * half width and a half height. A hoop is round and a hex gate is six sided,
 * and the corner of the square that holds a hoop is not in the hoop: a line
 * through it goes past the ring, not through it, and must not score.
 *
 * SO A SHAPE IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECTANGLE. clearW and clearH stay what they
 * always were for every piece, the size of the box the opening fits in, so the
 * envelope, the rules, the build sheet and the cards all read a hoop the way
 * they read a gate. The shape is what is left of the box:
 *
 *   square   all of it
 *   circle   the ellipse that touches all four sides (a circle where the two
 *            sizes are equal, which is what a hoop is)
 *   hex      the hexagon with a point at each end of the width and a flat at
 *            the top and the bottom: vertices at (+-w/2, 0) and (+-w/4, +-h/2).
 *            It is regular when h is the width times the square root of three
 *            over two, which is what a hex gate is.
 *
 * ONE DEFINITION, THREE READERS. The pass test clips a segment against it, the
 * scene builds the frame's capsules on its outline, and the builder draws the
 * ring on the same points, so a hoop is drawn where it scores and is solid where
 * it is drawn. Every point on a circle is taken with ./trig.js, which is the
 * same bits in every engine, because the capsules made from it reach the
 * physics.

 * the wrong way up, and the same way round), so the caller asks whether each corner is still the push from
 * the sides it was pushed off: layoutLetter in src/props/letters.js does.
