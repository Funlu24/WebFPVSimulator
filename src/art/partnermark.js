/*
 * partnermark.js: a partner's mark, painted into a freestyle map as a sign.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The partners in src/partners/roster.js are painted into every
 * freestyle map, the town and every map somebody built, the owner's ask of
 * 2026-09-27: "their logos always added to any freestyle map, finding one
 * pops an achievement like the old STF one". The STF mark is spray paint,
 * a stencil with overspray, because it is the project's own tag on the
 * world. A partner's mark is their livery, so it is a painted sign: the
 * partner's own artwork, in their own colours, on a flat panel of the
 * roster's `mark.field` with the town's ink line round it and a little
 * weather on it, the way a club's banner on a practice field or a shop's
 * panel over a door looks after a season outside. The artwork is never
 * redrawn, recoloured or stretched here: it is drawn from the partner's own
 * file, whole, at its own aspect.
 *
 * THE SIGN'S SHAPE follows the artwork: the logo takes LOGO_SHARE of the
 * sign's height and the same margin is left at each end, so the sign is
 * signAspect(p) = LOGO_SHARE * aspect + (1 - LOGO_SHARE) wide for each
 * metre it is high. ./maps/built/egg.js sizes a partner's wall to that, so
 * the sign is fitted to a wall rather than letterboxed on it.
 *
 * THE INTERFACE, which src/maps/built/index.js and
 * src/maps/city/places/index.js both call:
 *
 *   signAspect(p) -> number        the sign's width over its height
 *   partnerCanvas(p) -> canvas     the painted sign, SIGN_W wide, made once
 *                                  per partner and cached. The panel is
 *                                  painted at once; the artwork arrives
 *                                  when its file does and repaints every
 *                                  texture already made from the canvas.
 *   partnerDataUrl(p) -> string    the same canvas as a PNG data URL, for
 *                                  the found panel in the HUD.
 *   makePartnerMark(THREE, p, { width, height, look, shade }) -> Mesh
 *       Exactly makeStfMark's contract in ./stf.js: a plane `width` by
 *       `height` in its own XY plane facing +Z, lit by the same cel ramp,
 *       giving back the same share of its own colour at dusk, overcast or
 *       in shade (paintGlow), letterboxed and never stretched, castShadow
 *       false, renderOrder 1, userData.noOutline true. Its name ends in
 *       Trim, 'partnerMarkTrim', for the reason the STF mark's does: the
 *       town's collider fit, cover pass and audit read that suffix as drawn
 *       and not solid, which paint is. userData.partner is the slug.
 *
 * THE FILES are fetched rather than handed to an <img> by address, and made
 * into a picture from the bytes with the type their extension says, because
 * a static server with no MIME table answers an SVG as a stream of bytes
 * and a browser will not draw one of those (see logo() in
 * src/ui/credits.js). They are found from THIS file, two levels up and then
 * LOGO_DIR, so the address is right from index.html and from the board's
 * thumbnail page, src/share/orbit.html, alike. A file that does not load
 * leaves the panel with the partner's name lettered on it, which is still
 * their sign, and says so once in the console.
 *
 * Render only, like ./stf.js: nothing here reaches the physics.
