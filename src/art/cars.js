/*
 * cars.js: every car in the freestyle worlds, drawn in the town's cel look.
 *
 * ONE MODEL, THREE CALLERS. The town's own parked cars (the vendored
 * world/traffic.js parks them with makeVehicle, which hands the drawing to
 * townVehicle here through the hook in PATCH-world-vehicles.diff, and the
 * kei trucks through PATCH-world-props.diff), a built map's parked car
 * (src/props/kit.js town('car')) and a built map's moving car (src/maps/
 * built/cars.js) all come out of buildCar, so a kei van in a yard is the kei
 * van outside the conbini and the drift car is the same car parked or
 * sliding. The vendored builders keep their tables and their placement;
 * only the drawing moved, into this file, which is ours and GPLv3, so an
 * upstream update of the town is a re-copy plus two small patches.
 *
 * THE DIMENSIONS ARE THE TOWN'S, TO THE CENTIMETRE, BECAUSE THEY ARE
 * PHYSICS. L, W, R, the axles, sill, waist, roof, cab, the rakes and the box
 * lorry's box come from the vendored SPEC table itself (imported, not
 * copied), which is what the town's colliders (vehicleSize) and the built
 * map's solids and moving boxes (CAR_KINDS in src/props/street.js, VEHICLE_
 * KINDS in src/maps/built/traffic.js) are sized from. What this file adds
 * is SHAPE, never size: the side profile, the arches, the glasshouse's
 * tumblehome, the lamps, the glass, the wheels. The drawn body is built
 * round the solid boxes, not inside them: a flank is on the box's face, a
 * bumper stands out past L / 2 as the vendored bumper bar did, and where a
 * chamfer rounds an edge the solid's corner is at most about 3 cm outside
 * the paint (the shoulder, the roof edge; 5 cm at the top of the steepest
 * noses). The kei truck keeps makeKeiTruck's own sizes, which is what its
 * collider was written from. The r32 and the e82 are ours, not the town's,
 * and their tables carry the real coupes' numbers, which src/props/street.js
 * CAR_KINDS restates for their solids.
 *
 * HOW A TOWN KIND'S BODY IS MADE. Two bevelled prisms and what is laid on them. The
 * lower body is the car's side profile (bumpers, bonnet, the waist under
 * the glasshouse, the boot or tailgate, and the two wheel arches cut out of
 * its lower edge) extruded across the car with a chamfer round both flanks,
 * deeper at the four plan corners, which is what turns a slab into a car in
 * the cel ramp: the chamfer takes its own band of light, so a white car has
 * a pale rim along its shoulder and a violet one under its sill, and the
 * screen space ink finds a crease there to draw. The glasshouse is a second
 * prism on the waist, narrower than the body by a shoulder and narrowing
 * again to the roof (the tumblehome). Glass, lamps, grilles, shut lines,
 * handles, mirrors and wheels are laid ON those faces, a few millimetres
 * proud, never inside them (the town's rule: depth is built outward).
 *
 * THE ART'S RULES, the town's. Materials are the vendored cel() and flat()
 * with the town's ramps and violet shadow tints, in the looks the vendored
 * cars already used, so the town's bake folds a car into the batches its
 * neighbours are in and a new car costs triangles, not draw calls. Glass is
 * the palette's dark glass with a pale streak or two across it, the way an
 * animator paints a windscreen. The lamps are the two colours the vendored
 * builder lit a car with (LAMP_FRONT, LAMP_REAR), because src/props/kit.js
 * and src/maps/built/cars.js find the lamps by them to keep them lit at
 * dusk. No badge, no maker's name, no model name anywhere: a car in the
 * art style, recognisable from its shapes.
 *
 * THE SECOND PASS (every town kind; their rows say p2): each kind its own
 * face (FACES), lamps, grilles and intakes set in rims so they read as
 * recessed (pod), bumpers that are pieces of their own wrapping the corners
 * and standing proud (bumperLoft), lips on the arches (archLipP2),
 * shoulders and roof edges lit as rounds (prism's smooth), a reflection
 * band across the glass, wipers lying on it, better mirrors, and a tyre's
 * inner face so a far wheel is a tyre. The flank stands in by the lip's
 * stand so what is proud of it stays within the car's width.
 *
 * THE TWO COUPES ARE SCULPTED (THE SCULPTED BODY, below). The r32 and the
 * e82 are known by shapes a prism cannot make: the r32's blistered arches
 * under a crisp waist line, its slim lamps and four round tail lamps; the
 * e82's rounded nose with its twin grilles and ringed lamps swept back
 * round the corners, its hollow flank between two lines, its kinked rear
 * side window and wedge tail lamps. So each is lofted from rows, lines of
 * the body measured off side views of the real cars, and what it carries is
 * laid onto that surface by projection. Their solids are the boxes CAR_KINDS
 * has always given them, and the drawing keeps to them as the town kinds'
 * does: where the rounded plan corners leave a box's corner outside the
 * paint it is by 3.8 to 5.1 cm on the r32 and 7.5 to 8.6 cm on the e82,
 * the most the old prisms' corner bevels left (about 4 and 7.7 cm).
 *
 * THE THIRD PASS (2026-10-07), toward the stylised AAA look the owner
 * asked for, every kind keeping its sizes, wheel places, pivot, material
 * list and so its draw calls: arches cut in twelve facets where they had
 * seven, so they read as curves from a chase camera, with the arch lips
 * rolled over into the flank (round, smooth) instead of laid on it as
 * washers; a swage line pressed along the flank of every town kind but
 * the sedan, which has its chrome strip there, and along the kei truck's
 * cab, with an undercut steep enough for the outline pass to ink it
 * (swage), and the flank's light bent about that line, rolling under
 * below it and leaning in above, so a slab's side takes the cel ramp in
 * bands (prism's bend); a tailgate's shut line on the back of every town
 * kind but the sedan; pressed ribs across a panel van's roof and ditch
 * mouldings along the others' where nothing else stands on it; and wheels
 * with a fat tyre lit round its shoulder and bulging sidewall, a rim
 * flange standing out of the sidewall and a dish falling to a recessed
 * face, inked at both rings. It costs 1.3 to 1.6 times the town kinds'
 * triangles and nothing in draw calls; the coupes, already sculpted, gain
 * only the wheels.
 *
 * THE FOURTH PASS (2026-10-07), the owner's "lots of refinement" once
 * more, under the third pass's limits: what a car carries, at the
 * distances a pilot passes one. A real plate by class, off one sheet that
 * holds every plate and the few stickers a car wears (THE SHEET), so the
 * plate is still one material, and the plate in a dark holder; a bumper
 * drawn as a part, with a dark fitting gap round its top and, painted, a
 * black valance at its foot; rings round the round headlamps; the high
 * stop lamp; the filler flap; mud flaps on the working vehicles and side
 * markers on the lorry; and the door mirrors folded, as a parked car's
 * are, which brings every car's drawing back inside its solid's width
 * (out on their arms they stood 16 to 20 cm past it). And a car says
 * something about who drives it, read off what buildCar is handed and
 * nothing else (storyOf): the cabs with their wing mirrors, the two tone
 * keis, the learners' leaves, the tradesman's ladder. It costs at most
 * 1.75 times the second pass's triangles, and nothing in draw calls.
 *
 * TWO LEVELS OF DETAIL. 'parked' (every parked car, the town's and a built
 * map's) draws the wheels at 16 sides with their outer faces only; 'full'
 * (the moving cars, a handful on a map) draws them with both faces. A
 * moving car's wheels are not in the body at all: src/maps/built/cars.js
 * draws them from carWheelGeometry as instances.
 *
 * THE CONVENTION, the vendored one: nose along +x, origin at ground level in
 * the middle of the footprint, y up; `ry` turns the nose to (cos ry, 0,
 * -sin ry). Render only: nothing here reaches the physics, which reads the
 * tables and never a mesh, so Math.sin and Math.cos are used freely.

/*
 * THE BEVELLED PRISM: a side profile extruded across the car, its flanks

 * how far the flank's face is inset in the profile's own plane at that
 * corner, d how deep the chamfer runs across the car there. `hw(x, y)` is
 * the half width at a point, which a glasshouse narrows toward its roof.
 * `edgeRole(i)` names the material of the band face along edge i, so an
 * arch can be dark inside while the bonnet is paint; the flanks and the
 * chamfers take `role`. Returns the flank polygon, inset, for whatever is
 * laid on it.
 *
 * `bend(y)`, when given, turns the flank's light without moving it: the
 * flank stays the plane it was, so nothing laid on it moves, but each of
 * its points carries the normal (0, bend(y), 1) and a smooth chamfer turns
 * from its band to that. A bend that rises with y is a door skin that
 * rolls under toward the sill and leans in toward the shoulder, which
 * the cel ramp paints as two or three bands down the side where a plane
 * took one flat tone: the slab gone round.
 *
 * A normal is only true between a triangle's corners where the bend is
 * straight between them, so the heights at which it kinks (`bend.cuts`)
 * are cut into the drawing: every edge of the outline crossing one gains a
 * point there, which cuts the chamfers, and every triangle of the flank
 * crossing one is split along it. Without that a triangle running from
 * the sill to the roof spread the bend's kinks across itself, and the
 * band came out wavy. The outline handed back is the one drawn without
 * the cuts, which they leave where it was to a fifth of a millimetre.

 * the deep bumper with its wide mesh mouth, slatted ducts and dark lip; the
 * blistered flares under the waist's character line; four big round tail

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * THE SCULPTED BODY: the r32's and the e82's.
 *
 * The town's kinds are a side profile extruded across the car with its
 * edges rounded, which is right for a box on wheels and wrong for these
 * two, whose shapes are what they are known by: the r32's blistered
 * arches under a crisp waist, the e82's round nose with its lamps swept
 * back round the corners and its shoulder rising to the tail. So they are
 * modelled the way a car body is. ROWS run the length of the car, each a
 * line of the body (the sill, the character line, the shoulder, the
 * bonnet's edge, its crown, the centre line), each at its own height and
 * half width along the car and turning round its own plan corner at the
 * nose and at the tail. Row to row they are joined into bands of quads, and
 * at each end the rows' ends are joined across the car, which closes the
 * nose and the tail with the faces the lamps and grilles are laid on. The
 * glasshouse is a second loft standing on the waist, made the same way,
 * its ends the windscreen and the backlight.
 *
 * STATIONS are where the bands are cut. Every row is sampled at every
 * station, on its flank, round its corner, or held at its end, so the
 * rows that end first close to points and their bands to nothing, which
 * is not drawn. The arches cut the bottom rows: a row flagged `arch` keeps
 * that far over the arch's circle, so over a wheel the low rows stack on
 * the arch's edge and their bands become the edge's underside. The rows
 * that reach the arches are `fine`: they are cut at the arches' and the
 * flares' own stations as well as the ones every row is, and the rest at
 * the stations that shape the bonnet, the waist and the deck, so each kind
 * of station costs triangles only in the bands it shapes (stations()).
 *
 * LIGHT. A vertex's normal is the average of the faces round it, so the
 * cel ramp's bands run along the body as lines, except across a `crease`
 * row, an edge where the light breaks, and where two faces meet at more
 * than SMOOTH_LIMIT, which is a corner however it came to be drawn.
 *
 * WHAT IS LAID ON IT is placed by projection (Shell): a polygon drawn in a
 * view (the side's x and y, the front's or the rear's z and y, the top's x
 * and z, or a front or rear corner's, seen from 45 degrees) is cut along
 * the body's own facets under it and carried onto them, set off along the
 * surface's normal. So a lamp wraps round a corner in one piece, a window
 * follows the glasshouse's tumblehome, a pod sits on a curved face, what is
 * laid over something stays over it, and no surface is described twice.
 * Everything is drawn on the right of the car and reflected to the left by
 * the mesher (bothSides), or, seen from an end, laid again mirrored.
