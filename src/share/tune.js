/*
 * tune.js: flight feel tuning, the part of it with no page in it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Flight feel tuning is a mode, off by default, that puts two
 * more sliders beside the Weight slider while the quad is on the ground:
 *
 *   Air grip     how much the air holds the quad back, so how far it carries
 *                with the sticks centred. It drives sim_set_air, the scale on
 *                the body drag, the rotor H force and the ducted descent brake.
 *   Motor power  the motors' KV, how much speed they make for a volt. It
 *                drives sim_set_motor_kv, a scale on the winding: back EMF
 *                constant divided by it, resistance divided by its square.
 *
 * At the end of a flight flown off stock a pilot is asked whether the quad
 * felt better than the one that ships. If it did they may send the numbers
 * with their words to the board, as a ticket of kind "tune", so that what
 * pilots actually prefer can be read off the board over time by airframe and
 * by physics version. Nothing is sent without a yes.
 *
 * WHY A FILE OF ITS OWN. ui.js is seventeen thousand lines and needs a page,
 * main.js needs the module, and the numbers and words that cross to the
 * board need neither. They are also the part that has to agree with
 * WebFPVSimulator-LeaderBoard's src/validate.js to the digit: a pilot whose
 * tune is refused with a sentence about a slider has been failed by a
 * constant that moved on one side. So this file holds them once, has no DOM
 * and no module, and scripts/tune-selftest.js reads it in Node. The contract
 * is written out in full in the board's README, under Tunes.
 *
 * THE STOCK RULE, which is the whole safety of this feature. Tuning off is
 * stock, whatever the stored sliders say (effectiveTune), and a slider at 100
 * is exactly the double the module already holds, so a pilot who never turns
 * the mode on, or turns it on and touches nothing, flies the quad that
 * shipped, bit for bit.

/*
 * THE BANDS. A percentage of the machine as it ships, in steps of five, and
 * the board holds the same four numbers for each (the Tunes section of its
 * src/validate.js). Widen one here and it widens there first.
 *
 * Air grip is 50 to 150 because sim_set_air accepts 0.5 to 2.0 and refuses
 * anything outside it, and a symmetric band round 100 is the one a pilot
 * reads without a manual. Motor power is 80 to 120 because the winding scale
 * is a power law: at 120 the motors make 44 percent more power from the same
 * pack, which is already a different quad, and the module refuses anything
 * outside 0.8 to 1.2 (sim_set_motor_kv).
 *
 * WHAT THE AIR GRIP BAND DOES, measured off dist/sim.wasm by
 * scripts/tune-measure.js (npm run feel:measure) at the machine the shell
 * flies: the hands off carry is the run from 20 m/s to half of it with the
 * sticks centred at hover throttle in angle mode, and flat out is the fastest
 * level speed. Hover does not move at all, which is why the slider is safe to
 * leave on a pilot's memorised throttle.
 *
 *                        50       100      150
 *   five inch carry      54.8 m   26.9 m   18.0 m   (20 m/s to 10 m/s)
 *   five inch flat out   221      152      113 km/h
 *   whoop carry          18.8 m   9.4 m    6.4 m    (12 m/s to 6 m/s)
 *   whoop flat out       115      81       61 km/h
 *
 * So the two ends are the quad carrying twice as far and two thirds as far,
 * which is a difference a pilot feels in one corner, and not the "hardly
 * discernable" one the first air slider was reported as: that was asked about
 * vertically, and the vertical axis is gravity's, not the air's.
