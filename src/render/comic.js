/*
 * comic.js: the comic book layer, hatching and paint grit on every toon
 * surface in every map.
 *
 * The owner's ask of 2026-10-07: move the whole game toward Borderlands.
 * What makes that look is not the outline alone. It is that shadow is
 * DRAWN: a shaded face carries pen strokes, a deep shadow carries two
 * crossing sets of them, and a lit face carries the faint mottle of a
 * painted texture rather than a flat fill. This file adds both to the
 * lighting of MeshToonMaterial itself, so the race field (celmat.js), the
 * town and a built map (the vendored toon.js) all get the same hand with
 * one edit and no new pass and no new target. Its two textures, the
 * ground's detail map (pass 12) and the noise lattice (the low end pass,
 * src/render/lattice.js), are generated in code.
 *
 * WHY THE PROTOTYPE AND NOT EACH CALL SITE. The field builds its toon
 * materials through celMaterial and the freestyle maps through the
 * vendored cel(), and both install their own onBeforeCompile on every
 * material. The vendored file stays byte identical (CLAUDE.md, and the
 * PATCH-*.diff files beside it), so it cannot be edited to call this. So
 * MeshToonMaterial's prototype gets an accessor for onBeforeCompile: an
 * assignment stores the caller's hook, a read returns a hook that runs the
 * caller's and then adds the comic chunk. Every toon material in the game
 * therefore gets the chunk whoever built it, and every caller's own hook
 * still runs first and unchanged.
 *
 * THE PROGRAM CACHE KEY is wrapped the same way, and that is not optional.
 * three's default key is onBeforeCompile.toString(), and every read of the
 * accessor returns the same wrapper, so without this two materials whose
 * own hooks differ would hand each other a linked program: the bug
 * celmat.js's long comment on customProgramCacheKey describes. The wrapped
 * key is the caller's own key, or the caller's hook's source where it set
 * no key, with a suffix. The chunk is either compiled in or, on Low, not
 * (chunkOn below), and where it is, the brush marks, the grime and its
 * cracks are compiled in only where they draw (chunkVariant); every other
 * knob is a uniform. The suffix says all of that, so it is the whole truth
 * about the chunk a program carries.
 *
 * SHARED UNIFORMS. Each material's hook assigns the same uniform OBJECTS
 * from COMIC below, so one write here reaches every compiled toon program
 * at once, and the preset's level (setComicQuality) takes effect on the
 * next frame without a recompile. Between presets it takes a recompile,
 * because Low compiles none of it and only High the brush marks, and a
 * preset change builds the world again anyway.
 *
 * THE STROKES are world space, so they stay on the surface as the camera
 * moves rather than swimming across it, and they are kept a constant width
 * and spacing ON SCREEN: the stroke coordinate's screen derivative picks an
 * octave, two octaves are blended, and the width is measured in pixels. A
 * stroke a metre from the lens and one eighty metres away are the same pen.
 * Which way they run comes from the dominant axis of the world normal, the
 * cheap half of triplanar mapping, which is what a comic artist does too:
 * walls get one direction, floors another.
 *
 * WHERE IS SHADOW. The toon lighting has already worked out what the sun
 * gave this fragment (directDiffuse, after the ramp and the shadow map).
 * Divided by what the sun WOULD give this colour square on and unshadowed
 * (the first directional light's colour through the same Lambert term),
 * that is the ramp's own band times the shadow map: about one lit, about a
 * third on the dark side of either map's ramp, zero in a cast shadow,
 * whatever the map's sun strength or sky. The first version used the sun's
 * share of sun plus sky instead, and the field's strong sun put its dark
 * side at 0.79 of that, so the field's trees never got a stroke. That
 * fraction is the tone, and the strokes are its ink.
 *
 * Render only. Nothing here reads or writes the physics state. The one
 * texture (the ground's detail map, pass 12, further down) is generated
 * here from a fixed seed and sampled by scene materials, never by a full
 * screen pass, so the budget's P4 cannot move.

 * THE GROUND'S DETAIL MAP (pass 12).
 *
 * Seen from a quad a metre or two up, the ground is most of the frame, and
 * a flat fill there is the plainest thing on screen: it is also what tells
 * a pilot how fast the world is going by. The grit and the patches above
 * vary it over metres; what was missing is the texture of the stuff itself,
 * a turf's blades and a road's stones, at centimetres.
 *
 * Three tries at painting grass in the shader alone failed (pass 9, in
 * PROGRESS.md), all for the same reason: a pattern finer than a pixel has
 * to be faded by hand where the ground is foreshortened, which is
 * everywhere a pilot looks, and the fade ate it. A texture with mipmaps and
 * anisotropic filtering does that fade properly, so this is one: 512 square,
 * generated here at the first preset that wants it, from a fixed seed of
 * its own (never the world's rng, which plants the colliders), with no
 * trigonometry so every engine paints the same pixels. Each channel is
 * settled to a mean of exactly one half, so the coarsest mip is neutral and
 * the far field keeps the colour it had.
 *
 *   r  turf: short tapered strokes in every direction, light and dark,
 *      over a soft clumping. Painted blades, not photographed ones.
 *   g  aggregate: small light and dark stones in a mottle, for asphalt,
 *      concrete, dirt and sand.
 *   b  the turf strokes' hue, warm (dry) or cool (lush), so a lawn up close
 *      is several greens, which is how a painter does one.
 *   a  leaf clumps (pass 13): overlapping discs, each lighter at its top and
 *      inked along its lower edge, each laid over the ones before it, which
 *      is the scalloped canopy a comic draws for a tree. Up is +v, so a
 *      clump hangs the right way up on a canopy's side.

 * look the owner named. Both ink passes found a silhouette and a crease
 * with one pen at one reach, so every line in the frame was one weight.
 *
 * Four more depth taps, each SIL_REACH times as far out as one of the
 * pass's own four, ask one question per direction: is the centre the near
 * side of a silhouette within that wider reach? Through the centre and its
 * near tap goes a plane, in inverse depth, which is what a plane is linear
 * in across the screen. On any plane at any angle the wide tap lies where
 * that plane predicts and the residual is zero, so a road at a grazing
 * angle stays clean, where a plain difference of depth would ink it. Across
 * a ridge, where depth is continuous, the residual is a few hundredths.
 * Across a silhouette it is about half the share by which the centre is
 * nearer than what stands behind it, and against the sky that share is
 * all of it. The second test, that the wide tap lies well behind the
 * centre, keeps the line on the object's own side of its silhouette: the
 * background beside an object is never the near side of anything.
 *
 * So a silhouette is inked SIL_REACH reaches deep and a crease one reach,
 * and the heaviest lines are where an object stands against the sky or
 * against something far behind it, which is how a comic artist weights
 * them. Each pass fades it with distance in its own way (the field's much
 * nearer, see src/render/post.js). High only, as the occlusion is: four
 * taps. The including shader defines COMIC_SIL_DEPTH(uv) as the linear
 * view depth in metres at uv.

 * A CANOPY BLOB'S CODE, for the town's ink (graphics pass 19).
 *
 * The town's cherry and grove canopies are blobs of twenty or eighty flat
 * faces, shaded round, and its ink pass finds creases in depth alone: the
 * turn between two faces is a crease, so every blob was inked as a cut gem
 * or a geodesic dome, worst toward its rim, where a small turn is a large
 * change of depth. Finer blobs only move the lines toward the rim (pass 15
 * went from twenty faces to eighty, near the eye). What the ink needs to
 * know is the thing depth cannot tell it: whether both sides of a crease
 * are the same blob.
 *
 * So a blob writes that into the one channel nothing else reads. The town
 * draws into a half float target whose alpha every opaque surface sets to
 * one and nothing downstream uses (the ink writes one over it), and a
 * material marked comicBlob writes a code there instead: 0.25 to 0.75, one
 * of 128 values, hashed from where its instance stands, so two blobs side
 * by side almost never share one (and where they do, the concave line where
 * they meet and the far side's line still draw). The ink pass reads the
 * code at its centre and its four taps, and a convex crease whose taps are
 * all the centre's own blob is a facet, not a line. The outline, the line
 * between two blobs, and the line where a blob meets a branch or a wall are
 * all two codes, so they ink as before.
 *
 * Blended surfaces drawn over a blob mix its code away and get their lines
 * back, which is the right answer for them. The code is written only where
 * the material is opaque, and only after three's last chunk, so nothing
 * else in the frame changes. The ink half is in comicPipeline's blobs
 * option; a map that marks nothing pays one fetch on a crease's pixels.
 *
 * Since pass 21, on a map that draws edge highlights, every other opaque
 * toon surface writes its sun there too (LIT_BASE above), and the ink is
 * still the only thing that reads it.
 *
 * A built map's trees (pass 23) are blobs too, round on Low and clumps on
 * Medium and High, but the prop kit bakes every blob of a tone into one
 * mesh, so they have one origin between them and the hash above would give
 * a whole canopy one code. Their codes come from the geometry instead: the kit's leaf() hands
 * each blob a float attribute, one value on all of its vertices, and a
 * material marked comicBlobBaked reads that (COMIC_BLOB_BAKED). That is a
 * define, so those materials compile a program of their own, one for the
 * map; it keeps the attribute out of every other toon program, where a
 * missing attribute would read whatever the context last left there.

 * EDGE HIGHLIGHTS (pass 21): the fifth of the plan's five, and the one the

 * parapet, a step or a car's roof in a light colour where the sun catches
 * it, which is most of what makes a surface read as a made thing with a
 * worn edge rather than a fold in a sheet. The ink already finds every
 * convex crease, so the highlight costs one fetch on a crease's pixels
 * and nothing elsewhere: on the half of a crease's line that lies on the
 * face in more sun, the ink gives way to a pale, warm stroke, and the half
 * on the face in less stays ink. A crease between two faces in the same
 * light, a silhouette and an inside corner are ink as before.
 *
 * Which half is sunlit is the one thing depth cannot say, and a normal
 * rebuilt from the depth's derivative cannot either: at the crease itself
 * the derivative straddles both faces, and the first try drew every
 * highlight as a dotted line. The surface knows exactly, so it says: an
 * opaque toon surface writes its sun into the scene's alpha (FRAG_TAIL,
 * LIT_BASE), the channel the canopy blobs already use and nothing else
 * reads. The ink reads the centre's from the fetch it already makes, and
 * the far face's with one exact fetch at the tap across the crease, only
 * on a pixel that is a convex crease in the sun. Medium and High, in the
 * town and the yard; Low compiles none of it.
 *
 * Not on the race field. Its chain blooms from the scene's alpha, so it
 * cannot carry the code, and the same rule on its prepass normals (the
 * brighter of the two faces, by the sun in view space) was tried: the
 * normals are one aliased sample a pixel, the brighter face flips from
 * pixel to pixel along an edge, and the start blocks came out speckled
 * with white. The field's few hard edges keep their ink.
