/*
 * look.js: the Gem look, a polished polygon style that costs the flight loop nothing.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The comic layer (src/render/comic.js) is off on every preset
 * because it cost frame time and the testers did not want it (bug-09e28ecf).
 * The owner's rule of 2026-10-09 is that latency comes first, so the polish
 * that stays has to be work done once, when a world is built, never per frame.
 * Everything here is that kind of work: a colour, a vertex colour, a sky and
 * fog value. It adds no draw, no pass, no texture read, no shader arithmetic
 * and no shader program. The one other piece of the look is the finer toon
 * ramp in celmat.js, which is a texture's content and not its use.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, once per built world (main.js loadMap):
 *   - a little tone and hue variation per vertex, a darkening toward the foot
 *     of a wall and under an overhang, a lift on upward faces, written into
 *     the vertex colours a mesh already carries. A mesh with no vertex
 *     colours is left alone, because turning them on costs a multiply a pixel.
 *   - the sky's and the fog's colour a little fuller, and the fog a fifth of
 *     the way toward the sky's horizon so the two meet without a seam.
 *   - the key light a touch warmer.
 * Fog distances are not touched: the town's are its draw distance.
 *
 * Gates, markers and every other material colour are not touched either:
 * they carry meaning and the pilot reads them.
