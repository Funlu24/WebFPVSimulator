/*
 * WHY A SHADOW MAP DOES NOT NEED A REDRAW EVERY FRAME.
 *
 * Three redraws the whole map each frame by default: the sun's camera is
 * re-aimed at the craft, and every caster in its box is drawn again, 50 to
 * 90 draws and up to 180,000 triangles a frame on Medium (perf-hunt item 11).
 * But the world under the map does not move, and the camera is snapped to the
 * map's own texel grid, so a map drawn a few frames ago still holds the right
 * depths for every static caster. Three keeps the shadow matrix that goes
 * with the map it last drew, so a stale map is stale in what it covers and
 * never in where it puts a shadow: nothing slides, nothing crawls.
 *
 * What a stale map does cost is two things, and the gate below bounds both:
 * the box's edge, which trails the craft by how far it has flown since the
 * last draw (a few metres on a box tens of metres across, at its far edge),
 * and a moving caster, a car, whose shadow steps at the map's rate and not
 * the frame's. A redraw is therefore asked for when the focus has moved a
 * twenty fifth of the box's half width, or when `every` frames have gone by,
 * whichever comes first. At 20 m/s and 60 fps the first reads about every
 * second or third frame on the field and every frame or two in the town, so
 * the saving is in the quiet frames, the hover, the title and the slow turn,
 * and a flat out run is capped at one redraw in `every`.
 *
 * `every` of 1 is the old behaviour exactly: autoUpdate stays on and this
 * object does nothing. It is set on the renderer either way, because the
 * renderer is the shell's and outlives the world: the world that follows
 * must not inherit a switched off map.
