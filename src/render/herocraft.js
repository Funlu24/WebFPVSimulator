/*
 * herocraft.js: the 5 inch airframe, for the settings studio and the world.
 *
 * Same published dimensions and motor order as the plant: RR FR RL FL, front
 * at -z, 220 mm diagonal, 5 inch discs. src/render/craft.js is the session
 * wrapper that names it, scales it into the world, and keeps the body box
 * and prop discs as direct children so check 15 can still measure it.
 * Settings passes `lite` so the overlay skips outline hulls and shadow
 * casters; the world craft stays full, including on the title flythrough.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS A MODEL OF. A built freestyle five inch, the way one looks on a
 * bench: a carbon bottom plate with four separate arms bolted to it, a top
 * plate on four anodised standoffs, a 30.5 mm ESC and flight controller
 * stacked on grommets between them, a micro camera pivoting in printed TPU
 * cheeks at the nose, 2306 motors with their windings showing through the
 * bell, triblade props with real twist, a pack strapped under the frame on
 * a grip pad, the XT60 lead and its capacitor out of the back, and the
 * video antenna in a printed mount at the rear. It used to be a box sketch
 * of that: box plates, box arms, a box pack, a faceted pink dome where the
 * camera cage goes and four ghostly coins for props.
 *
 * HOW IT STAYS CHEAP. Every part that does not move is merged, by FINISH
 * rather than by colour: one mesh for everything matte (carbon, the pack,
 * the boards, the wires), one for the machined metal, one for the printed
 * TPU, one for vinyl, each wearing its colours as vertex colours over a
 * white cel material. A part costs triangles, not a draw call, so the
 * screws and the zip ties are close to free. What stays a mesh of its own
 * is what something else drives: the four rotors and the camera, which the
 * shell turns; the four discs and the four lamps, whose materials it
 * fades and colours; the windings, whose glow the studio warms; the glass,
 * which no finish shares; and the antenna, which scripts/craft-check.js
 * leaves out of the measured machine by its name. Twenty one meshes and
 * four ink shells where there were sixty five and sixteen. The triangle
 * counts, before and after, are in PROGRESS.md.

/*
 * PLACING A PART, by hand over its arrays.
 *
 * The model is a hundred and fifty parts, built when the page boots, and at
 * boot every function here and in three.js runs cold, in the interpreter,
 * where a call costs more than the arithmetic inside it. three.js moves a
 * vertex through several calls (read it out, multiply, write it back), all
 * over again for each of rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ and translate, and
 * BufferGeometry.clone() starts by building a throwaway default part of the
 * same kind, a 32 sided cylinder or a bevelled extrusion of a unit square,
 * only to copy over it. In a CPU profile of a cold build in Node, cloning
 * held a fifth of the samples and turning the plates a seventh. So a part
 * is turned and moved here in one pass with no calls in it. That bought
 * less than the profile promised, a profile being slower than the code it
 * watches: a sixth or so of a cold build, measured without one.
 *
 * Turning about x, then y, then z is the matrix Rz Ry Rx, which three.js
 * calls the Euler order ZYX. `turn` reads n vectors from `src`, through
 * `index` when there is one, and writes them turned, and moved by (x, y, z),
 * to `dst`, which may be `src` itself when there is no index. A normal is
 * turned, not moved, and comes out unit length.

 * THE INK SHELL, an inverted hull that is the same thickness everywhere.

 * wrong for a merged one: a merged frame's origin is the CG, so a 1.07 hull
 * puts 7 mm of ink beyond the end of an arm and almost none down its sides.
 * That is the reason the old model kept every arm and every bell a mesh of
 * its own, and paid a draw call and a hull for each.
 *
 * This pushes each vertex out along the MITRE of the faces that meet at it
 * instead, so every face of every merged part moves out by `width`, and a
 * box corner stays a corner rather than going round. Vertices are welded by
 * position to find their faces, because an unindexed geometry has a copy of
 * a corner for each face that shares it, and offsetting the copies along
 * their own face normals would open the shell at every edge.
 *
 * The shell keeps the part's own face normals. post.js's ink prepass draws
 * every mesh with one override material, hulls included, so the shell is
 * what the edge pass sees: with the part's normals it finds the same creases
 * the part has, and a smoothed shell would erase them. It is marked with
 * hullColor exactly as outlineHull marks its own, so scripts/craft-check.js
 * leaves it out of the measured machine for the same reason: it is paint.
 *
 * `src` is the geometry the shell is grown from, which need not be the
 * mesh's own: a finish merges the screws and the wires with the plates, and
 * a shell round a screw is a hundred triangles drawn twice (once here, once
 * in post.js's prepass) for a line nobody can see. So each finish keeps a
 * second, smaller merge of just the parts that make the silhouette, and the
 * shell is grown from that.
 *
 * Exported because src/render/whoopcraft.js inks the whoop with it. The weld
 * reads the position array three vertices to a triangle, so `src` must be
 * unindexed: herocraft's parts are, and the whoop's primitives are made so

/*
 * A five inch triblade, lofted rather than extruded.
 *
 * The old blade was a flat outline extruded 1.7 mm and laid in the disc
 * plane, which is a propeller with no pitch: a fan cut from card. A real
 * 5 inch has about 4.3 inches of geometric pitch, so its blade is steep at
 * the root and nearly flat at the tip, and that twist is the thing the eye
 * reads as "propeller". So each blade is a run of airfoil sections out
 * along the span, each one turned to the angle a 4.3 inch helix has at its
 * radius (capped near the hub, where the true angle passes 60 degrees and
 * the hub hides it anyway), with a flat bottomed section that is thickest a
 * third of the way back, a mid chord that sweeps back toward the tip, and a
 * rounded tip.
 *
 * THE TWIST HAS A HAND. A prop that spins counter clockwise seen from above
 * leads with the edge on its +x side at the blade that points to +z, and a
 * blade lifts when the edge it leads with is the higher one, so the two
 * hands are mirror images. `dir` is the rotor's PROP_SPIN, the same number
 * the shell spins the rotor by, so a rotor can never be drawn with the
 * pitch of the other hand.
 *
 * Station rows: radius, chord, sweep of the mid chord toward the trailing
 * edge, thickness. All metres. The tip band starts at 0.0555, which is where
 * the colour changes: the last tenth of a blade is the part that draws the
 * ring a spinning prop leaves, so it is painted lighter, the way a lot of
 * real props are. The two rows either side of that line are a millimetre
 * apart so the colour changes there rather than fading over a centimetre.
 * The station at 12 mm is narrower than a real blade is there on purpose:
 * it is over the bell, and at the capped pitch a wider chord puts its
 * trailing edge into the bell's top. From 22 mm out the blade is clear of
 * the motor and takes its full width.
 *
 * The section is four points, leading edge, crown, trailing edge and belly,
 * with the normals smoothed round it. At a millimetre and a half thick that
 * shades as an airfoil from any distance the chase camera gets to, and a
 * finer one was twice the triangles for nothing a picture could show.
