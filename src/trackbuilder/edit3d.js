/*
 * edit3d.js: the gestures of the whoop room, where a track is built.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A SECOND SET OF GESTURES. The 3D view was a preview, and its
 * drag on a gate that stood on the ground was an orbit: the natural gesture did
 * the opposite of what a pilot meant, and nothing in it could place anything.
 * On a whoop canvas the room is the tool now (WHOOP-BUILDER-PLAN.md, section
 * 3), and this file is what a press, a drag and a release mean there. The other
 * canvases keep view3d.js's own handlers, untouched.
 *
 * THE SPLIT. This file decides what a gesture is and asks the host to do it;
 * view3d.js draws, and knows where things are on the screen. So this module
 * holds no Three.js, is loaded with the view and costs nothing to a page that
 * never opens the room, and every change goes through the host's one door
 * (beginEdit, moveSelected, rotateSelected, endEdit, placeAt), which is how
 * undo, the autosave and the derived racing line come with it.
 *
 *   A tool armed:   a click on the floor places, and the tool stays armed. A
 *                   drag looks round instead, so the camera is never lost to
 *                   a tool. A ghost follows the pointer, snapped, with its
 *                   distance to the gate before it.
 *   Nothing armed:  press a gate, anywhere in it, and it is selected and can
 *                   be pulled across the floor. The ring at its foot turns it.
 *                   A press on empty floor orbits, and a click there lets go.
 *                   Shift drags a box. Right or middle drag pans.
 *
 * A press is not an edit. The undo step begins at the first real movement, so
 * a click that only selects leaves nothing behind.
 *
 * TOUCH. One finger does what the mouse does: a tap places or selects, a drag on
 * a gate moves it, a drag on the floor orbits. A second finger takes over: whatever
 * the first was doing is put back, and two fingers are the camera, sliding with
 * the pair's middle, zooming with the distance between them and turning with the
 * twist. The finger left when one lifts has no gesture to go on with (a gesture
 * begins with a press), so a lifted pair never becomes a stray move. Only fingers
 * are tracked that way; a pen is a mouse that cannot hover.
