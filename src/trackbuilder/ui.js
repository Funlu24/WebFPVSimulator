/*
 * ui.js: the panels. Palette, inspector, sequence, results.
 *
 * The page skeleton is static in index.html; this module only ever writes
 * into it. Everything here talks to the app through one method,
 * host.edit(label, mutate), which takes an undo snapshot, runs the mutation,
 * re-derives the faces and redraws. Panels never touch the document
 * directly, so there is exactly one place an edit can fail to become undoable.
 *
 * REBUILDING AND FOCUS. Every panel is rebuilt from scratch on every render,
 * which is simple and cannot get out of step with the document, and which
 * would normally throw away the caret while somebody is typing in a number
 * field. So the id of the focused control and its selection range are saved
 * before the rebuild and put back after it. That one trick is what lets the
 * rest of this file be as blunt as it is.
