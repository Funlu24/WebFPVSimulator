/*
 * passes.js: pieces and passes, for a whoop track where a piece is flown more
 * than once.
 *
 * A PIECE STANDS IN THE ROOM AND A PASS IS A MOMENT IN THE LAP. The document
 * keeps them apart already (sequence.js: one object is not one sequence
 * entry), and the builder drew them together: every pass had its own arrow,
 * its own number and, on a pole, its own square of coloured glass, all on the
 * same spot, so RaceGOW5 Track 8's tall pole, flown six times, was a heap.
 * This module is the one place that knows how the passes group up, which of
 * them is in focus, and which stretch of the racing line belongs to it, so
 * the room, the strip along its foot and the card all say the same thing.
 *
 * PURE. No DOM, no Three.js, nothing stored: a track written before this file
 * existed reads exactly as it did, and the schema does not move. What is in
 * focus is the builder's own state and is never in the document.
